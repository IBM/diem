### System Variables

There are a serious of system variables you can use in your job

```py
__id = '5fc536c677d005477917c89d'  # this is the id of the job
__email = 'guy_huinen@be.ibm.com' # the name of the user currently running the job
__jobid = '5fc536c677d005477917c89d' # the reference to the job id ( current job or pipeline reference)
__name = 'Sleep 1 (5)'  # The name of the job
__filepath = '/tmp/spark-local-dir'  # the path where you can store temp data
__transid = '6cd346a3-2f98-0e4c-85d9-d18d2c1caf0c' # the running reference of the job
__count = 0  # a count number that will be displayed on the etl main job page
__starttime: None
__jobstart: None
```

These variables are being exposed from the config module so you can use them as

```py
user = config.__email
```
