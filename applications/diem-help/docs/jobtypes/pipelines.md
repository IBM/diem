## Creating a jobs workflow

In this example we will move the job sleep 7(30) after the job sleep # (6)

![pipeline4](../../../diem-help/docs/images/jobtypes/pipeline4.png =600x)

- Go Into edit mode
- select the job you want to move (sleep & (30))
- click on the move x icon

![pipeline5](../../../diem-help/docs/images/jobtypes/pipeline5.png)

- All Jobs from the current pipeline will show up
- Select the job that will be the _parent_.
- You can select multiple jobs if needed
- Select if this job should be executed if all Parents are completed or may continue
- Press save

![pipeline6](../../../diem-help/docs/images/jobtypes/pipeline6.png =900x)

The Job is now moved as a child from sleep 3 (6)
